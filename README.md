libphonenumber-android
======================
Android port of Google's [libphonenumber][1].

Why?
----
Google's libphonenumber is a great library but it has to major flaws when used on Android:
 1. ~~It adds about [7k methods][2] to a final dex.~~ Not anymore, since 7.7.0.
 2. Internally the library uses `Class.getResourceAsStream()` method,
 which is [very slow on Android][3].

The goal of this library is to fix these two issues.

Download
--------
Gradle:
```groovy
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  implementation 'io.michaelrocks:libphonenumber-android:8.13.28'
}
```

For DexGuard users
------------------
If your project is obfuscated with DexGuard you may need to add the following line to the
DexGuard configuration:
```
-keepresourcefiles assets/io/michaelrocks/libphonenumber/android/**
```

API differences
---------------
This library is not fully compatible with the original `libphonenumber`.
 1. Every `libphonenumber` class is repackaged to 
 `io.michaelrocks.libphonenumber.android`.
 2. `PhoneNumberUtil` doesn't contain a `getInstance()` method so you
 have to create an instance of this class with one of 
 `PhoneNumberUtil.createInstance()` methods and store it somewhere.
 3. `PhoneNumberUtil` now has a `createInstance(Context)` method, which
 is a default way to obtain an instance of this class on Android.
